# Linux CLI tutorial

This repository contains a collection of notes and snippets for learning Linux CLI. The notes are organized into different sections, each covering a specific topic. The topics are in no specific order. The notes are written in a way that they can be used as a quick reference guide and are not meant to be a comprehensive guide to the topic. For more information about each topic see the related documentations.

*Note: This is a work in progress. I will keep adding more notes and topics.*
